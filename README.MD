# Medi Buddy


Welcome to our project! Over the course of this endeavor, we have achieved remarkable milestones and utilized cutting-edge technologies to bring this project to fruition.

## Description

Our project uniquely blends the capabilities of **Flutter**, **LangChain**, **Chainlit**, **Vector Databases**, **Retrieval Chains**, **Model Orchestration**, and **Quantization** to deliver an unparalleled user experience and outstanding functionality. Below is a detailed breakdown of the work we've accomplished:

### Key Highlights:

1. **Zephyr 7B Model & Fine-tuning**:
   - Utilized and fine-tuned the **Zephyr 7B Model** from Hugging Face.
   - Further enhancement was achieved with **Llama 2.0** and **Mistral 7B**.
